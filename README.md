## Modular Impelementation of Name Nationality Classifier in Pytorch 
This Project is object oriented implementation of names-classify project with modular and configurable structure. 

* persian names in dataset (Iranian.txt)
* names classify project can converted to other classify project with change dataset. 
* names classify project can be implemented with changing network type from LSTM to other type of recurrent networks
